Week 3 – Dimensionality Reduction in Practice

This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction techniques using Python, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE. The Iris dataset is used to visualize how high-dimensional data can be reduced to two dimensions for analysis and interpretation.

Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
